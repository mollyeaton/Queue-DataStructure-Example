# Queue-DataStructure-Example

## This project is a tested implementation of a Queue Data Structure written in C (using both a single pointer linked list and double pointer linked list)

To use this project you will need to create your own main/controller function as the methods created are meant to be general use methods. 

For these base methods a node struct is used to store each node's information including a name and a pointer which points to the next node. For the double pointer linked list implementation the pointers point to the previous node as well as the next node. You can enqueue/dequeue nodes onto/off of the queue however many times you wish for a look at how the data structure operates. To view the end contents of your queue there is also a printing method for displaying the resulting information stored.

The single pointer linked list and double pointer linked list options are written as separate executables.
